# dotfiles
kinda sorta dotfiles. Really just manual instructions (because any links will probably be dead next time I set up a computer from scratch) 

1. Install brew
2. Install rtx from brew tap
3. Install node
4. Clone my-vim, set up my-vim.
5. Install https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search (requires manual key config. terminfo doesn't report correct bindings for iterm2)
